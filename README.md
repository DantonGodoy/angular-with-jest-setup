# AngularWithJestSetup

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:4200/` and reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test-watch` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests (Cypress will be used in a later moment)

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
